        Ana is remembered as a loving and kind soul with a strong faith in God, deeply cherished her children and held education in high regard. She was married to Samiu Moala of Vaini and blessed with eight childrenâ€”seven daughters and one son. In addition to her roles as a mother and grandmother, she found joy in weaving, gardening, and maintaining a clean home. Known for her unwavering belief in her grandchildren, even the mischievous ones, she often reassured others that every individual has their time to mature and become a pillar of responsibility for others. Her legacy continues to inspire, grounded in her love for family, faith, and nurturing spirit.

            Families are Forever. 
                   
            <span class="more-text">Family is the foundation that shapes who we are, providing love, support, and a sense of belonging. Staying connected, even when miles apart, ensures that we continue to nurture our relationships, celebrate our heritage, and create new memories together. This website is a way to keep that connection alive, allowing us to stay updated on each other's lives and keep our family ties strong. As Proverbs 17:17 reminds us, "A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity." Family is there to support us through every season of life, and staying connected is vital to maintaining that support.
