        <h2>The Impact of Vaping on Your Body</h2>
        <p>Vaping might seem like a cool trend, but it's important to know how it really affects your body. While it may feel harmless, vaping has serious side effects, especially on the lungs, heart, and brain. Teenagers are still growing, and vaping can interfere with that development, leading to long-term health problems.</p>
        <p>It's not just about physical health either—vaping can affect your mood and concentration, making it harder to focus on schoolwork and stay motivated.</p>
