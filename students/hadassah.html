            <p>When you're feeling depressed, it can feel overwhelming to know how to help. The most important thing is to be there for them, even if it's just to listen. I want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to talk about them. Sometimes, simply knowing that someone cares and is willing to listen can make a big difference. Encouraging you to reach out to a professional, like a counselor or doctor, can also be really helpful. I'm here to support you however I can, whether it's spending time together or just checking in. You're not alone in this, and together we can find ways to navigate through it. </p>
